  2. Frontend Components


For the frontend, you'll need the following key components:

a. HTML structure:

- Main page with typing area
- Results page
- User profile page
- Leaderboard page


b. CSS:

- Responsive design
- Styling for typing area, results, and other components
- Dark/light mode (optional)


c. JavaScript:

- Typing logic (character matching, error detection)
- Timer functionality
- Words per minute (WPM) and accuracy calculation
- AJAX for sending results to the backend


3. Backend Structure (PHP MVC)


For the backend, we'll use the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

a. Models:

- User model (handle user data and authentication)
- Test model (manage test data and generation)
- Result model (store and retrieve test results)


b. Views:

- Templates for different pages (can be minimal if using a single-page application approach)


c. Controllers:

- UserController (handle user-related actions)
- TestController (manage test generation and submission)
- ResultController (process and display results)



4. Database Design


Create tables for:

- Users (id, username, email, password_hash, etc.)
- Tests (id, content, difficulty, etc.)
- Results (id, user_id, test_id, wpm, accuracy, timestamp, etc.)


5. Key Features


To create a typing test website similar to monkeytype.com, consider implementing these features:

a. User authentication and profiles
b. Random text generation for tests
c. Real-time typing feedback
d. WPM and accuracy calculation
e. Test history and statistics
f. Leaderboards
g. Different test modes (timed, word count, etc.)
h. Customizable themes

6. Development Workflow


Here's a step-by-step approach to building your typing test website:

1. Set up your development environment

Install a local server (e.g., XAMPP), a code editor, and Git for version control.

2. Create the project structure

Set up folders for frontend and backend components as outlined in the project structure diagram.

3. Develop the backend (PHP MVC)

Start with the MVC structure, implement models, views, and controllers for basic functionality.

4. Design and implement the database

Create the necessary tables for users, tests, and results.

5. Build the frontend structure

Create HTML templates for the main pages (typing test, results, profile, etc.).

6. Implement core JavaScript functionality

Develop the typing logic, timer, and WPM calculation.

7. Style your website

Apply CSS to make your website visually appealing and responsive.

8. Integrate frontend and backend

Use AJAX to connect your frontend with the PHP backend for seamless data exchange.

9. Implement user authentication

Add registration and login functionality.

10. Add advanced features

Implement leaderboards, test history, and different test modes.

11. Test and debug

Thoroughly test your website and fix any bugs you encounter.

12. Deploy your website

Choose a hosting provider and deploy your typing test website.
